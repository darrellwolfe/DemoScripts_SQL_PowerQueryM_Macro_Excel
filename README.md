Showcase some of my best work, and save some reference material for future builds.

SQL has become a passion of mine in 2023, but any code that solves a problem is wonderful to write. My greatest days were the ones in which I spent months looking for the data I needed and finally found it hiding in a random table name. 

These files serve as an example of the types of code I've written. 

The majority of these files represent my work with public data at the Assessor's Office for Kootenai County (GRM_Main server scripts for other Idaho Analysts). However, I will be adding more scripts as time goes on.
